## üöÄ Integration Tips for Block Banger

### Loading External Samples
```javascript
// Example: Loading from a reliable CDN
const SAMPLE_URLS = {
    kick: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/username/samples/kick.wav',
    snare: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/username/samples/snare.wav'
};
```

### Self-Hosting Samples
1. Download samples to a `samples/` folder
2. Update `audio-engine.js` to load from local files
3. Consider using a simple HTTP server for local testing

## Finding More Sounds

This project uses procedurally generated audio, so you don't *need* any external sound files to run it. However, if you want to modify the code to use real audio samples, or if you're just looking for sounds for other projects, here are some fantastic resources for high-quality, royalty-free audio.

### General Purpose Sample Libraries (Good for all types of drums, effects, and loops)

*   **SampleSwap**: A massive, well-organized library of royalty-free sounds. It's been around for over 20 years and has a huge variety of loops and one-shots. You need to register, but it's free.
*   **Freesound**: A collaborative database of Creative Commons licensed sounds. It's a treasure trove for everything from field recordings to synthesized effects. Pay close attention to the license for each sound!
*   **Looperman**: A community for musicians with a focus on loops, acapellas, and vocals. Great for finding inspiration. Requires a free account.
*   **BBC Sound Effects**: A huge archive of sound effects from the BBC, released for personal, educational, or research purposes.

### Piano & Realistic Instrument Samples

*   **SampleSwap (Instruments)**: Specifically, the [instrument sections](https://sampleswap.org/filebrowser-new.php?d=INSTRUMENTS+%28SINGLE+SAMPLES%29/) on SampleSwap have a great collection of single-note samples for pianos, guitars, and more. This is ideal for building your own virtual instruments.
*   **decent|SAMPLES**: Offers some high-quality, free sample libraries for use in their free `Decent Sampler` plugin. They have an excellent free [Basic Piano](https://www.decentsamples.com/product/basic-piano/) that is clean and well-recorded.
*   **Freesound (Packs)**: Searching for "piano loops" or "drum kit" in the [Packs section](https://freesound.org/browse/packs/) can yield curated collections of samples that are designed to work together. Check out packs like [this one for piano loops](https://freesound.org/people/josefpres/packs/35548/).

### Important Considerations

*   **Check the License**: Always check the license before using a sound. "Royalty-free" doesn't always mean "free to use in any context." Some licenses require attribution, while others prohibit commercial use.
*   **File Format**: For web projects, `.wav`, `.mp3`, and `.ogg` are the most common formats. Be prepared to convert files if needed.
*   **Quality**: Listen for clean recordings without background noise (unless that's what you want!). Higher bit depth and sample rates (like 24-bit, 48kHz) are great for production but may need to be down-sampled for web use to save space.

Happy hunting!
