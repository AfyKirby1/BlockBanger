1. Core Architecture & Timing Engine
Priority: High

Implement the Look-Ahead Scheduler
Build the high-precision timing engine described in Part 1.2.1. This is foundational for all rhythmic features (polyrhythms, MIDI sync, etc.). Use AudioContext for sample-accurate timing instead of setInterval.

Key Code Reference: The scheduler() and nextNote() functions in the paper.
Refactor to Component-Based Architecture
Adopt the vanilla JS component pattern (e.g., SequencerGrid, TransportControls) to manage growing complexity. Start with the sequencer grid and state management.

Key Code Reference: Component.js and SequencerGrid.js examples.
2. Music Theory & Generative Features
Priority: High

Integrate tonal.js for Scale/Chord Highlighting
Implement real-time key/scale highlighting on the sequencer grid using the data structures in Part 1.1.1. Start with a UI dropdown to select keys/scales.

Key Code Reference: updateUserScale() and renderSequencerGrid() functions.
Add Chord Progression Generator
Create a "Suggest Progression" feature using tonal.js’s Progression.fromRomanNumerals(). Include presets like "Pop/Rock" or "Blues".

Key Code Reference: generateChordProgression() example.
Euclidean Rhythm Generator
Build a UI control (e.g., "Generate Drums") that uses Bjorklund’s algorithm to create percussive patterns.

Key Code Reference: generateEuclideanPattern() function.
3. Rhythmic & Structural Features
Priority: Medium

Polyrhythms & Dynamic Pattern Lengths
Refactor the sequencer state to track per-track step counters (as in Part 1.2.2). Add UI inputs to adjust track lengths (e.g., 4, 7, 16 steps).
Song Mode for Pattern Chaining
Implement a data structure to save/load patterns and arrange them into songs. Start with a simple JSON-based system.

Key Code Reference: song object example in Part 2.4.1.
4. MIDI Integration
Priority: Medium

MIDI Input for Real-Time Control
Use the Web MIDI API to let users play the synth with a physical keyboard. Start with Note On/Off events.

Key Code Reference: handleMIDIMessage() and playSynthNote() functions.
MIDI Clock Output
Enable the app to act as a master clock for external hardware. Sync via precise MIDIOutput.send() calls.

Key Code Reference: Augment the scheduler() to send 0xF8 messages.
5. Sound Design & Effects
Priority: Medium

Velocity-Sensitive Steps
Update the step data structure to include velocity (as in Part 2.1.1). Add UI controls (e.g., draggable sliders) to adjust velocity per step.
Master Compression & Distortion
Add a DynamicsCompressorNode to the master channel and a WaveShaperNode for distortion effects.

Key Code Reference: setupMasterChannel() and makeDistortionCurve() examples.
6. UI/UX Enhancements
Priority: Low to Medium

Real-Time Visual Feedback
Add an oscilloscope using AnalyserNode to visualize the master output or synth waveform.

Key Code Reference: createOscilloscope() function.
Modernize UI Components
Style the sequencer grid and controls with CSS to look professional (e.g., hover states, responsive grids).
7. Advanced Features (Future Roadmap)
Priority: Low

Markov Chain Melody Generator
Allow users to train a melody generator on existing patterns or input sequences.

Key Code Reference: buildMarkovChain() and generateMelodyFromChain().
Polyphonic Synthesizer
Extend the synth to handle multiple simultaneous notes using AudioContext’s OscillatorNode and GainNode per note.
Implementation Order
1.
Core Timing Engine → 2. Scale Highlighting & Chord Progression → 3. Velocity Sensitivity → 4. MIDI Input/Output → 5. Polyrhythms & Song Mode → 6. Effects & UI Polish.
Key Technical Considerations
State Management: Use a centralized state object (e.g., sequencerState) to track patterns, tracks, and global settings.
Web Audio Graph: Ensure all effects (compression, distortion) are properly connected to avoid audio glitches.
Testing: Validate timing precision with external hardware (e.g., sync a drum machine via MIDI clock).
These recommendations balance immediate user value (chord highlighting, velocity) with foundational work (scheduler, components) to scale the app into a professional DAW.
